Set Commander decks
Starting with Commander 2020, the Commander releases are all thematically connected to other sets. This allowed R&D to supplement themes from the main set with new cards to help it work better in Commander decks. It also ties into the excitement for the set, including drafting off of all the marketing for it, it provides the opportunity to flesh out creative elements of the current plane, and it differentiates the decks from one another. Always being a blend of everything previously made them feel too similar.[7] After 2021, the Commander [year] template was abandoned, because all sets featured Commander decks.[8] The following decks were all connected to Standard legal sets.
