# MTG Precon Deck Price Analyzer
## Technical Whitepaper & Documentation

### Executive Summary

The MTG Precon Deck Price Analyzer is a sophisticated full-stack web application designed to analyze the current market value of Magic: The Gathering preconstructed decks. By leveraging real-time pricing data from the Scryfall API and providing an intuitive user interface, the application enables users to make informed decisions about deck purchases and investments.

The system processes CSV deck data (typically exported from Moxfield), performs comprehensive price analysis with automatic rate limiting, and presents results through interactive rankings, statistical summaries, and detailed card breakdowns.
